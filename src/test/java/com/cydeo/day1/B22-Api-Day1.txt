Welcome B22!
API Classes
Having 2 different intellij project
1 from GitHub, always get the updates
1 for yourself you type, get error, try to fix it.

API classes 3 main parts
1- 8-9 days (basics) completed everything for interview get the job
2- 2-3 days advance part(you might if you find api job) Junit5 
3- extra Postman Automation classes(1-2 Days)(will be teach by sth else who is implementing right now)



AMAZON UI 
Input box='Selenium'

{"productName":"Selenium"}


AMAZON BACKEND SEARCH API
String productNameFromUi = 'Selenium'

--logic 

Query = Select productName,productPrice
where productName = productNameFromUi;

Return 
["product":['Selenium pills',]]


AMAZON DB
Run query against to database

===========================================

API
we have 2 main usages of API.
1.Sharing information between different applications
for example websites like sky-scanner has access to different airlines api.
when we fill out the information like departure,from, dates it takes those info
and send as a request to different airlines APIs, this comminucation most of the time happens in JSON format. JSON is data storage structure in key and value format. 

Once sky-scanner sends request, if they have right to ask those information and if they ask in proper format, they will get RESPONSE most in the same format they asked which is JSON 
they will see available flights prices and dates, and they will only display those results in their website. 

Another example could be logining using gmail, hotmail, apple id etc in different websites like airbnb. they asked is this valid user, can I access some information like firstname, lastname,birthday etc, and if we give permission google lets say share those info with airbnb so that we don't need to register separately airbnb.

this was examples for the first usage of api.

Second usage of API is using api for building backend in single project. in this usage the main motivation is not sharing information with third party application , it is creating better backend structure to safer,faster, and allowing multi platform development easier.
For example, amazon has search functionally where we provide one product name and it takes that info look into to database and bring the result. there are many different ways to build backend which dont care as a tester, but using restapi or microservices one of the ways of building it. If developers uses apis basically they build one structure on top of database and we can communicate with that api through different tools like postman. communication again will happen with json or xml and it will be only data transfer. so how this is helping the company ?

After they build backend, they can easly map those json information to different application of their product. like they can easily build mobile application, and create connection with search api, it will be only basic data transfer between their mobile app and search api. 

these benefits motivate companies to build backend using api, so they hire more testers.

if you need api tester, we are here at Cybertek. 

===============================

First API we will test is Spartan api which runs yourIpaddress:8000 

POSTMAN
Start sth new
-Create new 
-HTTP request

if you are getting permission error, close the postman, go to postman icon on desktop, right click,
"Run as Administrator"

================
So we sent our first request to our ipaddress:8000/api/spartans endpoint which we learned from documentation, it displays all spartans

in postman we pick GET request fill out the URL part and add the endpoint.

As a RESPONSE we got 3 MAIN parts
-STATUS CODE
-HEADER
-BODY

How do I understand from status code my request is successful ?
we have 3 main type of status codes

2xx-> successful API request, there are different 200 types like 201,204 we will learn later
4xx-> which means client error, most of the we did some mistake, or we asked sth that we dont have right to ask
5xx--> if we 500, it is server/api mistake almost always. the server might me down or could not handle that much request. 


REQUEST
	-url+endponts
	-header
	-body
	-parameters

RESPONSE
	-statuscode
	-body
	-header


GIVEN spartanBaseurl +/api/spartans endpoint
WHEN I send a GET request
THEN status code must be 200
AND body needs to include spartan information


==============================================
Creating maven project for API automation 
1.File->new->Project
2.Please put B22-RestAssured-yourname as a project name, do your practice in the project.
GroupId= com.cybertek
3.Finish
==============================================
JSON
What is JSON? 
JavaScript Object Notation

Key value pair to represent data
Key will be always String

Values can be:
	String
	Number
	boolean
	null
	array
	json Object

Person: firstName,lastName,age

{
	"firstName":"Ihsan",
	"lastName":"Gozel",
	"Age": 22,
	"isMarried":false,
	"job":null,
	"hobbies":["traveling","reading","swimming"],
	"address":{ 
				"street":"jones branch",
				"zipcode":20007,
				"state":"VA",
				"phone":{
						"mobile":123123123,
						"work":4123123123
                           }
               }

}
