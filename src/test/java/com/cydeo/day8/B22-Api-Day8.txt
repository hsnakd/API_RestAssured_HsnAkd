Class Notes
AUTHENTICATION and AUTHORIZATION 

AUTHENTICATION --> verifies if you are who you say you are.

AUTHORIZATION --> verifies if you have access/permission to certian actions(API)

Spartan we have 3 different user types

user user 
editor editor 
admin admin 

guest 
401 --> invalid credentials, api doesnt know who you are ? 
403 --> valid credentials, but not enough access level/permission to do action

spartan running at port 7000 uses basic auth we can send our username and password by clickin autoraiztion tab on the postman and select basic auth

for spartan application we have 3 different users, and only admin can delete spartan based on the documentation. if you dont provide and username and password you will get 401 because api doesnt know who you are. but lets say you use user user as a credentials and try to delete you will get 403 because api knows you but you dont have right to delete your friends.
